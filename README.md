# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview
In this project we are creating a mapping show the data gathered for a year on earthquakes. We created an interactive map that shows the earthquakes as circles. The color and size of the earthquake is directly related to the magnitude of it....
## Analysis
There are 3 layers we added to the map.
- **Earthquakes**
- **Tectonic Plates**
- **Major Earthquakes**  

With these layers added, we created 3 map styles you can visualize with:  
- Street Map
- Satellite Map
- Dark Map  
## Results  
Here are the 3 map visualizations with all the data.
